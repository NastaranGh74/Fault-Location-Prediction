**High-impedance Fault Detection Study**

The fault current due to high-impedance faults (HIFs) is small and cannot be detected by relays. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find the phase and location of the HIFs using the transients in voltage measurements. To do so, first, the Daubechies-4 (db-4) discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to the voltage measurements to obtain the scale-2 wavelet transform coefficients (WTC). Later, the normalized wavelet energies of postfault three-phase transient voltages are calculated. The voltage measurements are captured in 10 ms intervals. The normalized wavelet energies are used as inputs for training and testing of the classification algorithm.
